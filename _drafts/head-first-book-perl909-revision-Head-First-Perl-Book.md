Some months back I have purchased [4th edition of Camel book, Programming Perl](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596004927.do). I am really liking the book and now a days I am focusing on Chap. 6 (Unicode) which I am going to implement in my project in up-coming months. Well, I was just wondering if experts in Perl community have plans to write a Perl book in [Head First series](http://headfirstlabs.com/). Well, the obvious answer could be that we already have excellent books then why we need this but I personally feel that Head First books are really good way of teaching which really can shorten leaning time. May be this can help in attracting more young guys to take a dip in Perl world in short time and later one can pick Camel book and others.

May be someone have already started writing but just a thought.
