In this COVID-19 scenario, everyone is trying to Work From Home depends on the job profile. 
 
Some basic guidelines for work from home:
- Good quality desk preferably with good width
- Min 2 monitors + Keyboard mouse combo
- Good Wireless Headphone
- Good natural light and Ventilation
- if possible a separate room or corner


Your work from home setup might different depends on your work profile. Being as a programmer here is my setup:

**Hardware:**

- Medion Akoya Laptop 16GB RAM + SSD + which I use to run my Linux + VMWare VM + Outlook
- Medion desktop + 16GB RAM 
- NAS server
- 12 port USB hub

**Software for managing multiple screens:**

- Synergy for synching mouse and keyboard
- Evernote for creating and sharing notes
- Slack
- TeamViewer
- Skype

I am following WFH for almost 5 years for now. Here are some of my suggestions:

- Start your workday at the same time as per your time zone.
- Follow routine including lunchtime, try to utilize this time if possible help in preparing some healthy food.
- Try to make todo for the next day by the end of the current day 
    I generally have datewise todo list which I prepare in advance so next morning when I start work I already know which tasks to be picked first, I generally pick the most difficult tasks first which requires deep work, most of the time I assign a time slot mostly of 40 mins to that task in that duration I put my phone on silent mode, no browser tab opened or only open tabs which are really necessary for that task. Idea is to focus fully on the task in hand. 

-  Utilize conf call time
    A lot of time spent during long conference calls so it's better to use that time to stretch a bit and do some deep breathing exercises. Wireless headphone are of great help. Make sure you charged them well each morning.

    Below is my typical setup:
