Generally, I only post technical contents in this blog, but this time there is an urge from inside to write due to unprecedented scenarios all over the world due to [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) scare. Today is the [Janata Curfew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Curfew) here in India which our PM has [initiated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9SRmRMv64s) Whole day we were homebound and in the evening everyone came out in their balconies and doing chant, ringing bells, clapping, etc. This is how it was -- [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qWixB_Mm9g) 

It was such an outstanding experience. This is people's support & respect for all medical & essential support personnel who are working tirelessly to combat. Right now, we as a country are in very critical junction, the future of us will be based on how resilient we are. Future gen will remember this a great community effort to save mankind.

India's one of the biggest train network is closed, taxi service is suspended, most of the cities are in lockdown state except essential services. This is happening all over the world. Hope we'll get through it.... 

This is an exceptionally difficult time and I feel that we should keep our mind in control and fight with our full strength and follow govt and experts. We as a human being evolved in millions of years so I think our body knows how to get rid of unwanted bug but maybe because of the way we live and treat nature this mechanism has shut itself? High time to re-initiate and learn from the mistakes we are doing in the name of blind progress. I think nature is telling us that this planet equally belongs to other living beings as well. 

So mind the gap and learn to co-exist. Scientifically we can't live without them but I think they can... I hope we get through this difficult phase and learn...

Praying for all human beings all over the world.

Take care!
