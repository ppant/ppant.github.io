Being trained in Physics I am a huge fan of [Prof. Richard P. Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) I learned about him more while studying Advanced Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics during my master's way back in 1995-96. The way he explained the concepts of Physics and Science in general is amazing and had huge impact on my though process. He was called Feynman the “Great Explainer” in his days. During my Grauduate studies there were only books and research articles to look but later other Feynman resources came. I kept following his work and newly published material audio/video and books.
I this post I am putting some of his best resources that I like and used. Apart from the core books and papers I have read his 2 books.

[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!](https://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041)

The Feynman Lectures on Physics is perhaps his most accessible work for anyone with an interest in Physics these are compiled from the lectures given in Caltech undergraduates during 1961–1964.
In 2013 these lectures were made available free online a new [website](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) by Caltech. 

There are plenty of videos on internet If you want to know more about him and his thoughts in general You can check The complete [FUN TO IMAGINE BBC documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1ww1IXRfTA) on Feynman.

Inspired by Feynman, "The Feynman technique" for teaching and communication is a mental model (a breakdown of his personal thought process) to convey information using concise thoughts and simple language. This technique is derived from Feynman's studying methods when he was a student at Princeton.

Apart from the lecturers on Science and Physics, Feynman was very famous for his humor and quotes in general. Below are some of them:

> ***
> ### *Five types of people you want to surround yourself with: the inspired, the passionate, the motivated, the grateful and the open-minded.*
***
> ### *You are under no obligation to remain the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or even a day ago. You are here to create yourself, continuously.*
***
> ### *What does a School really teach*
* ### *Truth comes from authority*
* ### *Accurate memory and repetition are rewarded*
* ### *Intelligence is the ability to remember*
* ### *Non-compliance is punished*
* ### *Conform: Intellectually and Socially*
> ***
btw there is a very good [twitter handle](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman) which gives Feynman quotes almost daily.

Enjoy!
