For quite some time, I am interested in building a static blog that uses markdown as the main data source and built on the top of javascript and newer technologies. My present website is a WordPress blog and being a techie I wanted to control my site and data through code. Then I stumbled by [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) static site generator that uses ReactJS, GraphQL. Actually it is built with API's and data can be delivered through [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) query. I have already made a small 2-page site which I am hosting on GitHub and developed using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

In my work also am planning to do a revamp of UI which is currently base on traditional HTML/CSS and native JavaScript.

and just as a coincidence I listened to a [podcast](https://www.se-radio.net/2019/11/episode-388-bob-kepford-on-decoupled-content-management-systems/) on my fav channel SE radio about decoupled content management systems and gatsby. More on decoupled CMS in my next post.

So time to explore newer JavaScript libs..

Happy Coding!
