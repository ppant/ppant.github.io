After a long wait finally a new release of my favorite HTML to PDF engine is available.Â <span style="line-height: 1.5;">This is a QtWebKit based rendering engine which supports CSS and is open source.</span>

See the source code and change log [here](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases/tag/0.12.0).

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Enjoy!</span>
