In this post we'll dig deep into process mining. You can read my [last](/tech/2022/07/02/business_process_and_process_mining.html) post on data mining and process mining.

Process mining versus Data mining

* Both starts from data
* Data mining techniques are typically not process-centric
* End-to-end process models and concurrency are essentials for process mining
* Process mining assumes event logs where events have timestamps and refer to prcess instances
* Process mining and data mining 

1. Introduction
2. Tell about data sceience and process science
3. Tell about data mining and process mining 
4. Tell about the junction of these two
5. Finally tell about what we are going to cover in next post mainly more about prcess mining techniuques don't go deeper in explamning just give some insights
6. Make a good story and try to give some edge to user in understanding the domain

Happy reading!

Process mining use cases
What is the process that people really follow?
What are the bottlenecks in my process?
What do people (or machines) deviate from the expected or idealized process?

Challenges in Process Mining
Finding, Merging, and Cleaning Event Data
Dealing with complex event logs having diverse characteristics
Creating representative benchmarks
Balancing Between Quality Criteria such as Fitness, Simplicity, Precision, and Generalization
Cross-Organizational Mining
Providing Operational Support
