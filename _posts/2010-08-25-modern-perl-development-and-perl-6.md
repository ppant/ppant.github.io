Hi

While watching a Perl 6 video on [YAPC::EU 2010](http://www.presentingperl.org/ye2010/perl-6-prince-of-parsea/), I was wondering if year 2010 is going to be big for development in Perl programming or more specifically in [Modern Perl based development](http://search.cpan.org/~chromatic/Modern-Perl-1.03/lib/Modern/Perl.pm) ([Moose](http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/),[Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org/) etc). There are many new exciting module on Moose/MooseX, [DBIx::class](http://search.cpan.org/~frew/DBIx-Class-0.08123/lib/DBIx/Class.pm), Catalyst etc are uploaded on [CPAN](http://www.cpan.org/) every month. I think the biggest news is the release of long awaited [Rakudo Star](http://rakudo.org/) in July 2010. This is a stable, usable [Perl 6](http://dev.perl.org/perl6/) implementation on [Parrot Virtual Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_virtual_machine). Congratulations to all developers/testers of this project. One can download the tar ball the release from [Github](http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads.). I am going to explore and develop some applications using this exciting new language Perl 6.

I will try to show some exciting features of Perl 6 in my next post.

Happy programming!
