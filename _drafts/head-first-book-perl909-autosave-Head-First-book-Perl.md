Some months back I have purchased [<span id="GRmark_2870b2011f61767cfca3fce80d745b0596bbdf42_4th edition:0" class="GRcorrect">4th edition</span> of Camel book, Programming Perl](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596004927.do). I am liking the book and at present focusing on Chapter 6 on Unicode. Well, I was just wondering if the experts in the Perl community have plans to write a Perl book in [the Head First series](http://headfirstlabs.com/). Well, the obvious answer could be that we already have excellent books then why we need this? But I personally feel that Head First books have <span id="GRmark_d9b1081a1b5122af1ee68e1df0449512e77a3492_quite delightful way:0" class="GRcorrect">quite delightful way</span> of teaching which can shorten learning time. May be this can help in attracting more guys to take a dip in the Perl world in a short time and later one can pick the Camel book and others.

I don&#8217;t know if someone had already started writing? But just a thought.

Thanks
