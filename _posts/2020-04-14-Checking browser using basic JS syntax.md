Here is a quick post on how to check the browser name based on ````userAgent ```` 
property which returns the value of the user-agent header sent by the browser to the server based on the value program can do some actions. This is mainly needed for IE and Edge browsers again Microsoft issue ðŸ˜­

````js

	if ((/MSIE 10/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) ||
		(/MSIE 9/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) || 
		(/rv:11.0/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) ||
		(/Edge\/\d./i.test(navigator.userAgent))) { // Microsoft browsers     
	alert('IE 9, 10, 11, Edge');	
		// do some action 
	}	
	else { // Chrome, Safari, Firefox
		alert("Chrome, Safari, Firefox");
	}
````
