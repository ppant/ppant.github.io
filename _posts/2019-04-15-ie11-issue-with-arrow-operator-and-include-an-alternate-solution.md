Again one more Microsoft problem <span style="font-size: 1.375rem;">ðŸ˜¢Â </span>ðŸ˜¢

Yesterday, IÂ  suddenly observed that one part of my newly developed feature was not working in IE11. This is a simple feature which contains two select boxes, user can select the one or multiple items from the first select box and copy to another select box. I have added a kind of logic there which checks before copying if the item(s) to be copied are already in list 2, if true, alert the user and skip copying duplicates. While developing I checked this feature in chrome, Edge and Firefox and all work perfectly!Â  I couldn&#8217;t check in IE11 and that was my mistake as IE is infamous for such issues. While debugging I saw that IE11 was crashing on the places where I have used the functionsÂ  => and .include. Actually, the arrow function is not supported in IE 11. You can refer to this compatibility table: <a href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/" rel="nofollow">https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/</a>Â to get an overview of what is supported where and to what extent in a detailed fashion. You may read more on arrow functions at below link:Â

Check below a small demo which shows the problem and an alternate which solves the IE11 issue.
