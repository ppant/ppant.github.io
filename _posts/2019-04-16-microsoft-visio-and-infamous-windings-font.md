Another Microsoft misery ...............

This time, I am struggling to handle the bullets in SVG output of my drawing.  What I found is that  MS Visio still uses windings/symbol fonts to make the bullets. Don&#8217;t know why? When are they going to change this and start using standard Unicode chars? Can anyone from MS please explains to me why they don&#8217;t believe in standardization?

IMHO Please use Unicode everywhere be it HTML generated from Word or Visio etc. 

Thanks for reading!
