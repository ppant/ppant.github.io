I like the way, [_Prof. Ravindran_](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) explains complex topics in an easy way. I took one of his course in _Data analytics and reinforcement learning_ a __couple of years back and learned a lot.

I hope this new course will help learners who want hands-on [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). I will do a review of the course in the coming months.

Happy learning!

Thanks
