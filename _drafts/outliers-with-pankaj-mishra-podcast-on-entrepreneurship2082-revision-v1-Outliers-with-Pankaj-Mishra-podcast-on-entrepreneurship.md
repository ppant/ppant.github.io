Found this interesting podcast focusing on the Indian IT landscape, start-up, journey and entrepreneurship in general. The bio says &#8221; _A podcast about the ones who chose to take the road not taken often. It’s about the crazy and the curious. Those that dared to stand out, and stand-alone. It’s about their journey through hope and disillusionment, failures and pitfalls, joy and success, pain and bliss. It’s a candid exploration of experiences and ideas that have driven some of the shining stars, told as is._ &#8220;

So far I have listened to a couple of them and found an enriching conversation. 

Happy listening!
