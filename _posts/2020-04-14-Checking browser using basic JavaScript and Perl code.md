Here is a quick post on how to check the browser name based on ````userAgent ```` 
property which returns the value of the user-agent header sent by the browser to the server based on the value program can do some actions. This is mainly needed for IE and Edge browsers again Microsoft issue ðŸ˜­

JavaScript:

````js

	if ((/MSIE 10/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) ||
		(/MSIE 9/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) || 
		(/rv:11.0/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) ||
		(/Edge\/\d./i.test(navigator.userAgent))) { // Microsoft browsers     
	alert('IE 9, 10, 11, Edge');	
		// do some action 
	}	
	else { // Chrome, Safari, Firefox
		alert("Chrome, Safari, Firefox");
	}
````

Perl code:

````perl
	sub detect_browser {
		my $user_string = $ENV{'HTTP_USER_AGENT'};
		# NOTE: This is a quick check 
		# For more eloborated checks better to use a module e.g.; HTTP::BrowserDetect	
		if ($user_string =~ /Edge\/\d.|MSIE 10|MSIE 9|rv:11.0/i) { # IE, Edge	
		return 1;
		}
		else { # Chrome, Safari, Firefox	
		return 0;
		}	
	} # end of detect_browser
````

I will write a elaborated post on IE/Edge issues which I have faced recently.

Cheers!
