Along with my [AI class](http://pradeeppant.com/2011/10/17/ai-class-unit-2/ "AI Class Unit 2 Problem Solving") course,  I have also started [DB class](http://db-class.org/) (Oct-Dec session) from [Standford online courses series](http://pradeeppant.com/2011/10/10/online-ai-course-at-standford/ "Online AI course at Standford"). Actually, learning DB was long due and this seems to be perfect opportunity. In my professional life I write SQL queries and sometime modify the database schema but that is all job requirement, going through full course content again (after my degree) is really an opportunity and I don&#8217;t want to miss it.  Course instructor for this class is [Jennifer Widom](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~widom/) and I am really liking her teaching style so I am bit excited. Well, I have almost completed first part and some of the points covered in this part are:

&nbsp;

  * <span style="color:#008000;">DBMS features</span>
  * <span style="color:#008000;">Key concepts like Data model, schema, DDL, DML</span>
  * <span style="color:#008000;">Key people like Database designer, Administrator, developer</span>
  * <span style="color:#008000;">Relational model XML data &#8211; DTD, XSD &#8212; This covered really well along with XML validation</span>
  * <span style="color:#008000;">Relational algebra</span>
  * <span style="color:#008000;">Intro to SQL</span>
