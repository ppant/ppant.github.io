          # For organization or user pages (like USERNAME.github.io), 
          # the deployment usually goes to the 'master' or 'main' branch directly,
          # or a 'gh-pages' branch if it's a project site.
          # Given the repo name USERNAME.github.io, it's a user page.
          # The peaceiris/actions-gh-pages action defaults to deploying to the 'gh-pages' branch.
          # For user/organization sites, you might need to specify the target branch if it's not gh-pages,
          # or ensure your GitHub Pages source is set to 'gh-pages' branch.
          # However, for USERNAME.github.io, pushing to gh-pages is standard for project sites,
          # but for the root user site, it might expect content on master/main.
          # Let's assume for now the default behavior of deploying to 'gh-pages' is acceptable,
          # and the user will set their GitHub Pages source to the 'gh-pages' branch after this runs.
          # A common alternative for USERNAME.github.io sites is to build and commit directly back to the 'master'/'main' branch.
          # For simplicity and common practice with this action, we'll stick to `publish_dir: ./_site` which implies `gh-pages` branch.
