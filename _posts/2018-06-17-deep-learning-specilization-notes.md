A couple of months back I have completed [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) taught by AI guru Andrew NG. During the learning process, I have made personal notes from all the 5 courses.  Notes are based on lecture video and supplementary material provided and my own understanding of the topic. I have used lots of diagrams and code snippets which I made from course videos and slides. I am fully complying with **The Honor Code**. **No programming assignment and solutions are published on GitHub or any other site**.

Please note that most of the places I am not using exact mathematical symbol and other notation, instead using plain English name this is just to save some time, also please note that this is a personal diary made during course and I guess a bit longer too and few places not very well organized, so in any form doesn&#8217;t replace the content and learning process one follows during course which includes quizzes, programming assignments, project etc. This is a great course so I encourage you to enroll.

What you will learn at the end of the specialization:

**Neural Networks and Deep Learning:** This course gives foundations of neural networks and deep learning. How to build and train. At the end of this course, we&#8217;ll in position to recognize cat so will make a cat recognizer.  [[PDF]](/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning.pdf)

**Improving Deep Neural Networks &#8211; Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization:** In this course, we&#8217;ll learn about practical aspects of the NN. Now you have made NN/deep network so the focus is on how to make it perform well. We&#8217;ll fine tune various things like hyperparamater tuning, regularization algorithms and optimization algorithms like RMSProp, Adam etc. So this course helps greatly in making model perform well.  [[PDF]](/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Improving-Deep-Neural-Networks.pdf)

**Structuring your Machine Learning Project:** In this course, we&#8217;ll learn how to structure machine learning projects. It is observed that strategy for machine learning projects has been changed a lot in deep learning era. For example, the way you divide data in train/test/dev set has been changed in the era of deep learning also whether train and test data comes from the same distributions etc.? we&#8217;ll also learn about end-to-end deep learning. The material in this course is relatively unique.  [[PDF]](/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Structuring-your-Machine-Learning-Project.pdf)

**Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN):** CNN is often applied in images mainly in computer vision problems. In this course, we&#8217;ll learn about how to make these models using CNN&#8217;s.  [[PDF]](/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN.pdf)

**Natural Language Processing-Building Sequence Models:** In this course, we&#8217;ll learn about algorithms like Recurrent Neural Network (RNN&#8217;s), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and learn how to apply them with the sequence of data like natural language processing, speech recognition, music generation etc.  [[PDF]](/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Natural-Language-Processing-Building-Sequence-Models.pdf)

Happy learning!

Pl, drop a note in case of any feedback.
