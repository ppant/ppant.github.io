My first encounter with [WebDav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) protocol back in 2004-05 when I was writing the web part for SharePoint. WebDav is an old protocol of the &#8217;90s but still very useful in certain scenarios.

WebDAV (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918" target="_blank">RFC 4918</a>) is an extension to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">HTTP</a>, the protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other. The WebDAV protocol enables a webserver to behave like a fileserver too, supporting collaborative authoring of web content. For an example, one can edit a word document online directly on the server using WebDav protocol. A web server that supports WebDAV simultaneously works like a fileserver. So, that’s a_ **powerful capability**_. 

In many of its use cases, WebDAV is being replaced by more modern mechanisms like Wikis, cloud solutions, etc. But it is still a reliable workhorse when the right servers and clients are matched, so it’s still encountered in many different applications. 

<p class="has-text-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">
  Some of the servers which have implemented WebDav:
</p>

  * Apache HTTP Server
  * Microsoft IIS
  * Box.com 
  * WordPress
  * Drupal
  * Microsoft Sharepoint
  * Subversion
  * Git
  * Microsoft Office 
  * Apple iWork
  * Adobe Photoshop etc.
