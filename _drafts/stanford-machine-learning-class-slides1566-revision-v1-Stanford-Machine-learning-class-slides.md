[Andrew NG](http://www.andrewng.org/) Machine learning [class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is the best class so far which I took online.

Apart from the course video sometimes lecture slides are also important for quick reference. For quite some time, I was looking for them as they are not available on course home.

Here all the lecture slides available at:  
<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/ml/docs/slides/Lecture1.pdf>

Lecture2.pdf

Lecture3.pdf

Lecture4.pdf

and so on&#8230;

&nbsp;

My own experience slides only make sense if you go through the full video course.  Professor is an amazing teacher.

&nbsp;

Enjoy learning.
