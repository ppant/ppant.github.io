I like the way, Prof. Ravindran explains complex topics in an easy way. I took one of his course in Data analytics and reinforcement learning couple of years back.

I hope this new course will help learners who want to hands-on learn [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). I will do a review of the course in the coming months.

Happy learning!

Thanks
