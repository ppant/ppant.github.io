Some days back I have attended a virtual conference in Data Science organized by [ACM SIGKDD](https://ikdd.acm.org/kdd2020/) and [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) 

This year I have started to attend a few of the conferences to get the latest research trends in Data Science/AI research. As I have recently started my Ph.D. from [IIIT, Allahabad](https://www.iiita.ac.in/), so this is needed. Check my post [Why I have started Ph.D. after working 15+ in Software Industry?](/2020/08/29/why_am_I_doing_phd)).

Here I am listing a brief about the talk. I would strong spare time and listen to all of them. You can see my personal recommendation below as well. 
 
<span style="color:blue">**AI & ML in the Times of COVID**</span>

**Speaker:** *Prof. Partha P. Chakrabarti - PPC, IIT Kharagpur* 

This was the first talk and I joined a bit late, a general overview of how ML/AI is evolving in these challenging times. No prior knowledge is needed to attend.

<span style="color:blue">**A data-driven approach for country-level COVID Management**</span>

**Speaker:** *Dr. Kamakoti V., IIT Delhi*

An excellent talk gave a depth understanding of the Arogya Setu case study, how the data-driven model works, how the application integrates with other parts like PostgreSQL, Cloud, Bluetooth, epidemiologists.

<span style="color:blue">**Fake news**</span>

**Speaker:** *Joyojeet Pal. Microsoft, US*

Interesting case study of Mis-information and fake news. Can be attended by anyone. 
 

<span style="color:blue">**City-scale agent-based simulator for modeling COVID-19 spread**</span>

**Speaker:** *Prof. Rajesh Sundaresan, IISC, Banglore*

Excellent talk about Agent-based Simulator and modeling for Covid 19. It gives great insight into how the covid spread in close integration, how agent-based works in the city-based system, a study done for Banglore and Mumbai, and a good case study of the proposed school opening in Banglore. This can be further extended to other use cases like trains restart, school restarts, traffic modeling, odd-even in Delhi. Great speaker. Very practical use cases.

<span style="color:blue">**The State and Fate of Linguistic Diversity and Inclusion in the NLP World**</span>

**Speaker:** *Dr. Kalika Bali, Microsoft*

The State and Fate of linguistic diversity inclusion in the NLP world, No of resources, no people speak that language. The interesting outlook from a linguist trained computer engineer,

<span style="color:blue">**Object Detection in Scientific Plots**</span>

**Speaker:** *Dr. Mitesh Khapra, IIT, Madras*

Natural images vs scientific images object detection, why object detection is not always successful, localization accuracy. This talk is a bit advanced level, a bit understanding of computer vision will be helpful.

<span style="color:blue">**Landscape of regularized Auto-Encoders for generative modeling: Intro, challenges & new directions**</span>

**Speaker:** *Dr. Prathosh A.P.*

This talk is a bit mathematical and focuses more on new research on adversarial encoders etc also how the Generative model works. A very good talk for researchers.

<span style="color:blue">**Sketch-based Image Retrieval**</span>

**Speaker:** *Dr. Soma Biswas, IIISC, Banglore*

This is such an interesting talk. This talks about Sketch retrieval
cross-modal retrieval SBIR or Sketch-based image retrieval. The basic idea is to give a sketch to the model and get the corresponding image. This can be very useful for the search for the right product from the catalog just draw a sketch and find the product. So technically here the input is different modality and output is different that's called cross-modal modality. One of the great use-cases could be in surveillance where police or authority can match a sketch with a criminal list with the database and get some insight. Must watch.
