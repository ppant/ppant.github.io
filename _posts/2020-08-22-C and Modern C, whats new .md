Though C was not the first programming language I started writing computer programs (there were Assembly, COBOL, Fox Pro, if I remember). I first started C dev back in 1998, I still remember the most puzzling part was pointer manipulation, I must say it took some time to really understand how this works with memory management. Today, more than 2 decades I now mostly develop web applications so coding much of C, though in my existing projects we have written some ````for```` loops in C for better performance and optimization which one can call from Perl/Python/Java modules or any other programming API's but not following much on C development. So now the question comes that why I am talking about C in my blog. 

Well, last week I was listening to a podcast on my fav [SE radio channel](https://www.se-radio.net/) regarding Modern C. I really loved the episode as that gives me good progress report of C development. The podcast guest and author of the Modern C book by [Jens Gustedt](https://twitter.com/gustedt) has given amazing insights on C standardizations. Just a brief about Jens, Author of the Modern C book, former co-editor of the C standard document ISO/IEC 9899:2018 and a senior scientist at the French National Institute for Computer Science and Control (INRIA)

He talks about why people still use C, what is classed as Modern C, what is legacy C, and what has changed in the past 50 years in the C world. They also talked about standardized, Threads (the modern way), memory management, programmers vs compilers, security coding, casting, ecosystems, embedded C. They also mention about GCC and small C lib [Musl libc](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/) and how companies optimize their compiler for optimization also best practices and what you should do in your C career as a software engineer. 

Just finished listening to this interview. Such great insight on C dev and future.

in the end, I really touched by your philosophy of publishing as a free book. 


I would strongly recommend listening to this [podcast](https://www.se-radio.net/2020/06/episode-414-jens-gustedt-on-modern-c/).
