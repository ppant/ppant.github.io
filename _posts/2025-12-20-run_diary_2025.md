2025 turned out to be a packed year of running, travel, and learning. Between work commitments and regular training, I managed to participate in five endurance events across different parts of the country. All of them involved trails in some form, except one high-altitude road ultra — each offering a different challenge and a different story.

I couldn’t find the time to write individual race reports for each event, so this post is a consolidated race diary. It captures the essence of these runs — the journeys from Bangalore, the shared stays, the time spent on the course, and the lessons that stayed long after the finish lines.

## 🏃‍♂️ Vagamon UTrail – 36K

📍 **Location:** [Vagamon, Kerala, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagamon)  
📅 **Date:** January 18, 2025  
⛰️ **Elevation:** ~800 m – 1400 m  
📈 **Elevation Gain/Loss:** +1187 m / -1316 m  
🛤️ **Terrain:** ~85% paths · 5% tracks · 10% roads  
🏅 **ITRA Points:** 2  
📏 **Distance:** 37 KM · [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/13387116651)

Vagamon UTrail marked the start of my 2025 running season and, like most of our race weekends, it began with a road trip from Bangalore 🚗. A small group of us travelled together, turning the long drive into part of the experience — conversations, shared playlists, and the gradual shift from city roads to misty hill routes.

[Vagamon UTrail 2025](https://www.vagamonultrail.in/) is an **ITRA-certified trail run**, and it had been on my list for a while. Initially, I was planning to run the 60K, but later decided to go with the 37K distance this year, mainly to experience the trail that I had heard so much about. In hindsight, that turned out to be a very good decision.

We stayed close to the race venue, keeping things simple — early dinner, gear checks, and a calm night before race day. Preparation for this run was straightforward: regular walking, daily short runs, and strength training — nothing fancy, just consistency.

The course was absolutely beautiful 🌄. Long stretches ran through rolling hills and **lush tea gardens**, offering postcard-like views that made it easy to forget the effort for a moment. Most of the route followed well-defined paths, making the run feel runnable while still demanding respect due to the steady climbs.

At the start of the race, I had a fall and hurt my knee 🩹 — one of those moments where you pause, assess, and decide whether to continue. Thankfully, it wasn’t serious enough to stop, and after a quick check, I managed to carry on. The rest of the run became more cautious, but also more focused — listening closely to the body and adjusting pace accordingly.

Post-race, we regrouped like always — tired, relieved, and content — replaying moments from the trail over food and coffee ☕. It felt like a satisfying and honest way to kick off the year.

💡 **Takeaway:** Trails test more than fitness — resilience and calm decision-making matter just as much.

## 🏃‍♂️ Ooty Ultra – 60K (Road Run at Altitude)

📍 **Location:** Ooty, Tamil Nadu, India  
📅 **Date:** March 23, 2025  
⛰️ **Altitude Range:** ~2100 m – 2600 m  
📈 **Elevation Gain:** ~2000 m  
🛣️ **Surface:** Road (High-altitude climbs)  
📏 **Distance:** 60 KM · [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/13962826182)

Ooty Ultra was very different from most of my races this year. While I usually prefer trail runs, this was a **high-altitude road ultra**, and the challenge came not from technical terrain but from elevation, exposure, and persistence. Like most race weekends, it began with a long drive from Bangalore 🚗 — familiar faces, winding hill roads, and the gradual realization that the air was getting thinner.

This wasn’t my first time at Ooty Ultra. In fact, it was my **fourth time at the event** — three times as a runner and once as a volunteer. That familiarity helped, but it didn’t make the race any easier.

Race day turned out to be **hot and demanding** ☀️. With long stretches of road and very little tree cover, the sun was relentless. The altitude made breathing harder, and I struggled during the first **15–20 kilometers**, dealing with early cramps and discomfort. It was one of those phases where everything feels off, and the only option is to stay patient and keep moving.

Slowly, things began to settle. I adjusted pace, focused on hydration, and broke the race into smaller sections. The long climbs demanded steady effort rather than speed, and by the later stages, it became a test of mental resilience more than physical strength.

I managed to pull through and finished **just in time**, tired but satisfied. It wasn’t a smooth run, but it was an honest one — the kind that teaches you something.

As always, the event was exceptionally well organised. Huge credit to Coach Kay and the **[Ooty Ultra team](https://www.instagram.com/ootyultra/)** for their efforts in making the race smooth, safe, and memorable. Off the course, it was another fun trip with friends — shared travel, shared fatigue, and shared stories.

💡💡 **Takeaway:** At altitude, heat and patience matter more than pace. This race also highlighted the need to improve my early-phase running, as I tend to struggle initially before finding my rhythm later.

## Jhavadu Ultra – 50K

Jhavadu Ultra felt familiar in the best possible way. Another road trip from Bangalore, another early start, and the same small group coming together for yet another trail adventure. By this point in the year, our routine was well established — drive, stay close to the venue, and keep things uncomplicated.

The race offered classic trail running — steady climbs, rugged paths, and long stretches that required focus. I ran this one at a controlled effort, letting experience guide pacing rather than chasing anything aggressive.

Post-race recovery was unhurried. We spent time together stretching, talking, and laughing about small moments from the trail.

**Takeaway:** Familiar routines and familiar faces make tough races feel manageable.

## Malnad Ultra Night – 50K

Driving from Bangalore into the Malnad region always feels special — winding roads, dense forests, and cooler air gradually taking over. Malnad Ultra Night added another layer to that experience by taking the race into the night.

Staying together before a night race had a different energy — quieter, calmer, and more inward-looking. Headlamps were checked, batteries charged, and conversations were brief but meaningful.

Running through the forest at night was immersive. The silence, broken only by footsteps and forest sounds, demanded complete attention. Even when running alone, knowing your friends were somewhere on the same trail added comfort.

We regrouped after the finish, tired but content, sharing that quiet satisfaction unique to night runs.

**Takeaway:** Night runs sharpen focus — and shared silence can be as powerful as shared conversation.

## SRT Ultra Pune – 50K (DNF)

SRT Ultra Pune began like many other race weekends — an early drive from Bangalore, shared optimism, and confidence built over previous races.

Unfortunately, race day didn’t go as planned. Missing the second cut-off meant a DNF. It was disappointing, but having the team around made it easier to accept. There was no immediate analysis — just support and understanding.

The drive back offered time to reflect, not just on the race, but on the importance of respecting cut-offs and listening closely to the body.

**Takeaway:** DNFs hurt, but shared journeys soften the blow and turn setbacks into lessons.

## Final Thoughts – More Than Just Races

Looking back, what stands out most from 2025 isn’t just the distances or finishes — it’s the journeys between Bangalore and the race locations, the shared stays, the early mornings, and the quiet drives back home.

Running with a small, familiar group made every event more meaningful. From road trips and simple accommodations to post-race conversations and shared fatigue, these moments added depth beyond timing or results.

Some races flowed, one didn’t — but each experience reinforced why endurance running continues to appeal to me: for the learning, the humility, and the people who share the journey.

That balance — pushing limits on race day and keeping life simple off the course — is what keeps me coming back.
