This was my first ultra run experience though by distance it was not a "ultra run" but level of difficulty and elevation no less. Prep wise havn't done anything special just followed my daily workout which is mix of cycling and running. Towards end I have given some time to strength workouts. 


Here are some pics from our trip:
