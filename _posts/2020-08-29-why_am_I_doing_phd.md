So finally I have enrolled in a Ph.D. program. The obvious question is why now in 2020? 

Do I need a Ph.D. to advance my career? Well the answer is a big NO 

So why I am taking so much burden at this stage of my life to start something which will require a great amount of time, energy, also some money. 

I am in my mid 40's and doing well in my career as a software engineer/Architect I still code and design software systems and have no immediate intention to switch to academic anytime soon. 

Well, my quest for Ph.D. is not new, I enrolled myself in Ph.D. from [BITS, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2004/2005 that time I was a faculty member at [BITS, Pilani Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) (what a fantastic time that was :-) but soon in 2005 I switched to the industry but a thrive was always there, I even got a chance to be interviewed at [CSE IIT Delhi](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/) almost 10 years back but couldn't continue. Now after so many years I finally started my Ph.D. in the old city where I have spent some time in the late '90s. 

I feel one of the reasons why my quest for a Ph.D. is still up because at some point my late father had a wish to see me as a college professor with a Ph.D. degree. My father himself was a school teacher but never attended a university but he used to have great regard for university teaching. 

Technically, Ph.D. will definitely help in understanding more about Machine learning and AI mostly the complex maths behind it. 

I am very privileged to be associated with Data Analytics Laboratory (DAL) at [IIIT-A](https://www.iiita.ac.in/). The coordinator of the DAL and my guide [Dr. Manish Kumar](https://profile.iiita.ac.in/manish/Home.html) has great expertise in the field of IoT/Sensor Networks/Machine Learning. I hope to learn a lot from my Ph.D. and hopefully something interesting comes out from this collaboration. 

I thank my company [Ockham b.v.b.a](www.ockham.be) for allowing me to do this.

More posts expected in the future about my Ph.D. journey. I am sure this is going to be a fun journey...

Thanks!
