Some months back I have purchased [4th edition of Camel book, Programming Perl](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596004927.do). I am liking the book and at present focusing on Chapter 6 on Unicode. Well, I was just wondering if the experts in the Perl community have plans to write a Perl book in [the Head First series](http://headfirstlabs.com/). Well, the obvious answer could be that we already have excellent books then why we need this? But I personally feel that Head First books came up with a quite delightful way of teaching which can shorten learning time. May be this can help in attracting more young guys to take a dip in the Perl world in a short time and later one can pick the Camel book and others.

May be someone have already started writing? (I don&#8217;t know) but just a thought.

Please comment. I will edit all the comments on this post.
