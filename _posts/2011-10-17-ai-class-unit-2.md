<span style="color:#993300;">I have completed the AI-Class Unit 2 problem solving. It has 38 sub-sections so will take some hours to finish. Some of the algorithms covered are:</span>

  * <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#008000;">Tree search</span>
  * <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#008000;">Graph search</span>
  * <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#008000;">Breath first search</span>
  * <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#008000;">Uniform cost search</span>
  * <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#008000;">A* search</span>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#008000;">and topics on state spaces</span>

<span style="color:#993300;">Though my quiz score are not so good.. may be this was the first assignment but the quiz score is not counting on my final score Â so that&#8217;s good news. Now I am concentrating on Homework 1 which will be closed in some hours.</span>

<span style="color:#993300;">There are some very good notes on <strong><span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://larvecode.tumblr.com/tagged/ai-class"><span style="color:#0000ff;">this link</span></a></span></strong> on Unit-1 and some part of Unit-2. Keep on visiting this site, I believe it is getting updated regularly. Another<strong><span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://www.aiqus.com/questions/"><span style="color:#0000ff;"> site</span></a></span></strong> which I am liking is AI-Class Q&A community. Check it out and ask any question regarding course topics, assignments etc.</span>

<span style="color:#008080;">Good luck!</span>

<span style="color:#008080;">See u later with more updates.</span>
