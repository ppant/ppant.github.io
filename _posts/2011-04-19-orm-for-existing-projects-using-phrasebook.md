Just few questions came in mind so I thought to get some expert advice. Well, I am not an DB expert but comfortable with SQL/Perl DBI and can write queries using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~rani/Class-Phrasebook-0.88/Phrasebook.pm" target="_blank">Phrasebook</a>. I mostly use PostgresSQL DB. As there is a lot of discussion of ORM and many new implementations are coming using ORM techniques (e.g.; [DBIx::Class](http://search.cpan.org/~abraxxa/DBIx-Class-0.08127/lib/DBIx/Class.pm) etc) for DB interaction so just wondering how can I use ORM in my existing projects as I am still using DBI + Phrasebook and what benefit shall I get if I switch to ORM?

Thanks for reading!
