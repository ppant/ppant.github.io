Some days back I have attended a virtual conference in Data Sceince organized by [ACM SIGKDD](https://ikdd.acm.org/kdd2020/) and IIT Madras. 

This year I have started to attend few of conferences to get the latest researh trends in Data Sceience/AI research in India and globally. As I have recently started my Ph.D. from IIIT, Allahabad (check my earlier post "Why I have started PhD after working 15+ in Industry?").

how the Gerative model works, 

 
**Sketch-based Image Retrieval

Sketch retrival
cross modal retirval SBIR ( sketch based image retrival)
basic idea is to give sketch and get the corresponding image
make a sketch and get a image in serach from a catalogue
so input is different modality and output is diffent that's called cross modal modality
in surveliience match a sketch with criminal list with the database 
Zero shot leaaning not seen a single image in training
