Hello Guest,	
Welcome! My name is Pradeep Pant. I started this blog way back during autum 2007 to document and share my thoughts on tech landscape. By profession, I am a Software Engineer, writing computer programs for more than 2 decades. I love solving problems and believe that programming has the great power to transform human imagination into reality in a very short time. Well, I might not be the best engineer but I do constantly try my best to learn new things. Apart from this, I have various interests like trekking, hiking in mountains especially [Himalaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas) (probably because I have seen these snowy mountains all through my childhood), running, cycling, meditation, nature photography and reading. 

Thanks for visiting.
