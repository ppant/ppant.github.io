In this post we'll directly start with what process science is and how this is connected with data science.


Before we go into Process mining let's try to understand in brief what Process Science and how is this related to Data Science.

As we all know data science is a well established field with state-of art tools and techniques avaliable. 

What is the process that people really follow?

This picture shows a entry gate of a park with gate to stop cyclists to enter the park so that is process but if you see the actual path its different story. This means that people actually follow something other than the defined path. So question comes that how do we know what actual path user has followed? With advancement in ICT one hting which One of the best way to get which path was followed is to study the event data from IT system.

Process mining versus Data mining

* Both starts from data
* Data mining techniques are typically not process-centric
* End-to_end process models and concurrency are essentials for process mining
* Process mining assumes event logs where events have timestamps and refer to prcess instances
* Process mining and data mining 

1. Introduction
2. Tell about data sceience and process science
3. Tell about data mining and process mining 
4. Tell about the junction of these two
5. Finally tell about what we are going to cover in next post mainly more about prcess mining techniuques don't go deeper in explamning just give some insights
6. Make a good story and try to give some edge to user in understanding the domain

Happy reading!

Process mining use cases
What is the process that people really follow?
What are the bottlenecks in my process?
What do people (or machines) deviate from the expected or idealized process?
