Hello Guest, <br>	
Welcome! My name is Pradeep Pant (प्रदीप पन्त) native of hills of lower [Himalaya (हिमालय)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas). <br>
I started this blog way back during autum 2007 to document and share my thoughts on tech landscape. By profession, I am a Software Engineer and Researcher, writing computer programs for more than 2 decades. I love solving problems and believe that programming has the great power to transform human imagination into reality in a very short time. Well, I might not be the best engineer but I do constantly try my best to learn new things. Apart from this, I have various interests like running, cycling, reading, meditation, nature photography, trekking.

Thanks for visiting.
