## About Me

Welcome! My name is Pradeep Pant (प्रदीप पन्त), a proud native of the majestic lower Himalayas (हिमालय) region. I began this blog in the autumn of 2007 to chronicle my journey and share thoughts on the ever-evolving world of technology. Over the years, it has grown into a space where I explore ideas, document experiences, and share learnings from both professional and personal pursuits.

I am a Software Architect and AI/ML practitioner with a deep interest in building systems that solve real-world problems. I enjoy working at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and research, and I believe programming is a powerful medium for turning ideas into reality. Curiosity, continuous learning, and thoughtful problem-solving shape how I approach my work.

Alongside my professional interests, I am deeply passionate about trail running and endurance sports, and I actively participate in and organise community-driven initiatives. When I’m not working with code or research, you’ll usually find me running in the hills, exploring nature, or writing about my experiences here.

## 💼 Professional Journey

My professional journey spans over two decades and reflects a gradual evolution from systems development and academia to enterprise software and AI/ML.

After completing my M.Sc. in Physics (Electronics Specialization), I worked during 1997–1999 in systems development and technical consulting, contributing to industry oriented projects for small organisations and institutions. This phase involved hands-on work with digital systems, microprocessors, embedded programming, and software development, building a strong foundation in hardware software integration and practical problem-solving.

From 1999 to 2005, I was actively involved in teaching and academic roles at institutions such as Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Birla Institute of Applied Sciences, and BITS Pilani. During this period, I taught subjects including programming, electronics, digital design, microprocessors, and computer systems, while also mentoring students and supporting applied technical projects.

In 2005, I transitioned fully into the IT industry. Since then, I have worked across enterprise software and product engineering roles, including organisations such as Xerox Inc, Wokana Technologies, and Ockham BV, contributing to large-scale systems, software architecture, and long-term product development for global companies.

In recent years, my focus has shifted towards AI/ML, Generative AI, and MLOps, combining applied industry work with academic research. Alongside hands-on development, I actively mentor engineers, support hiring and team building, and work at the intersection of research and production grade AI systems.

I currently work as an AI/ML & Generative AI Architect at LTIMindtree, focusing on building scalable, production grade AI systems for enterprise environments.

## 🤝 How I Can Help

With a background spanning software engineering, AI/ML, MLOps, and applied research, I work best at the intersection of complex systems and real-world constraints. I typically help organisations and teams in the following ways:

- **Designing and scaling AI/ML systems**  
  Helping teams move from experimentation to robust, production-grade AI systems, with a strong emphasis on reliability, observability, and long-term maintainability.

- **End-to-end MLOps & time-series solutions**  
  Building and improving pipelines for time-series forecasting, monitoring, and model lifecycle management, ensuring models remain accurate and trustworthy over time.

- **Applied AI & Generative AI adoption**  
  Guiding the practical use of ML, Generative AI, and LLM-based systems in enterprise environments focusing on value creation rather than hype.

- **Research-to-industry translation**  
  Bridging academic research and industry practice, particularly in areas such as process mining, concept drift, and explainability, and turning research ideas into deployable solutions.

- **Technical leadership & mentoring**  
  Supporting team building, mentoring engineers and data scientists, and helping organisations strengthen their technical culture and decision-making.

I enjoy working with teams that value clarity, fundamentals, and thoughtful engineering, whether the goal is to build new capabilities, improve existing systems, or explore research-driven innovation.
