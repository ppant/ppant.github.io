2025 was a year of varied terrain,long drives,early starts,and quiet lessons on the course. Between work,travel,and regular training, I managed to line up for five endurance events- each very different in character yet connected by a common thread: the love for long hours on foot and the journeys that come with them.

Most of these races began the same way, a road trip from Bangalore with a small group of friends,sharing playlists,conversations and that familiar mix of excitement and nervous energy. Some runs flowed smoothly while some tested patience and one reminded me quite clearly that the mountains always have the final say.

Instead of writing individual race reports,this post is a consolidated race diary- a snapshot of my 2025 running season. It captures the experiences,the people,the travel,and the learnings that stayed with me long after the finish lines.

## 🏃‍♂️ Vagamon UTrail – 36K

📍 **Location:** [Vagamon, Kerala, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagamon)  
📅 **Date:** January 18, 2025  
⛰️ **Elevation:** ~800 m – 1400 m  
📈 **Elevation Gain/Loss:** +1187 m / -1316 m  
🛤️ **Terrain:** ~85% paths · 5% tracks · 10% roads  
🏅 **ITRA Points:** 2  
📏 **Distance:** 37 KM · [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/13387116651)

Vagamon UTrail marked the start of my 2025 running season and, like most of our race weekends, it began with a road trip from Bangalore 🚗. A small group of us travelled together, turning the long drive into part of the experience - conversations, shared playlists, and the gradual shift from city roads to misty hill routes.

[Vagamon UTrail 2025](https://www.vagamonultrail.in/) is an **ITRA-certified trail run**, and it had been on my list for a while. Initially, I was planning to run the 60K, but later decided to go with the 37K distance this year, mainly to experience the trail that I had heard so much about. In hindsight, that turned out to be a very good decision.

We stayed close to the race venue, keeping things simple: early dinner, gear checks, and a calm night before race day. Preparation for this run was straightforward: regular walking, daily short runs, and strength training — nothing fancy, just consistency.

The course was absolutely beautiful 🌄. Long stretches ran through rolling hills and **lush tea gardens**, offering postcard-like views that made it easy to forget the effort for a moment. Most of the route followed well-defined paths, making the run feel runnable while still demanding respect due to the steady climbs.

At the start of the race, I had a fall and hurt my knee 🩹 — one of those moments where you pause, assess, and decide whether to continue. Thankfully, it wasn’t serious enough to stop, and after a quick check, I managed to carry on. The rest of the run became more cautious, but also more focused — listening closely to the body and adjusting pace accordingly.

Post-race, we regrouped like tired, relieved, and content, replaying moments from the trail over food and coffee ☕. It felt like a satisfying and honest way to kick off the year.

💡 **Takeaway:** Trails test more than fitness — resilience and calm decision-making matter just as much.

## 🏃‍♂️ Ooty Ultra – 60K (Road Run at Altitude)

📍 **Location:** Ooty, Tamil Nadu, India  
📅 **Date:** March 23, 2025  
⛰️ **Altitude Range:** ~2100 m – 2600 m  
📈 **Elevation Gain:** ~2000 m  
🛣️ **Surface:** Road (High-altitude climbs)  
📏 **Distance:** 60 KM · [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/13962826182)

Ooty Ultra was very different from most of my races this year. While I usually prefer trail runs, this was a **high-altitude road ultra**, and the challenge came not from technical terrain but from elevation, exposure, and persistence. Like most race weekends, it began with a long drive from Bangalore 🚗 — familiar faces, winding hill roads, and the gradual realization that the air was getting thinner.

This wasn’t my first time at Ooty Ultra. In fact, it was my **fourth time at the event** — three times as a runner and once as a volunteer. That familiarity helped, but it didn’t make the race any easier.

Race day turned out to be **hot and demanding** ☀️. With long stretches of road and very little tree cover, the sun was relentless. The altitude made breathing harder, and I struggled during the first **15–20 kilometers**, dealing with early cramps and discomfort. It was one of those phases where everything feels off, and the only option is to stay patient and keep moving.

Slowly, things began to settle. I adjusted pace, focused on hydration, and broke the race into smaller sections. The long climbs demanded steady effort rather than speed, and by the later stages, it became a test of mental resilience more than physical strength.

I managed to pull through and finished **just in time**, tired but satisfied. It wasn’t a smooth run, but it was an honest one — the kind that teaches you something.

As always, the event was exceptionally well organised. Huge credit to Coach Kay and the **[Ooty Ultra team](https://www.instagram.com/ootyultra/)** for their efforts in making the race smooth, safe, and memorable. Off the course, it was another fun trip with friends — shared travel, shared fatigue, and shared stories.

💡💡 **Takeaway:** At altitude, heat and patience matter more than pace. This race also highlighted the need to improve my early-phase running, as I tend to struggle initially before finding my rhythm later.

## 🏃‍♂️ Jawadhu Hills Ultra – 50K

📍 **Location:** Jawadhu Hills, Tamil Nadu, India  
📅 **Date:** November 1, 2025  
⛰️ **Elevation:** ~Up to 1000 m  
📈 **ITRA Points:** 2  
🛤️ **Terrain:** Forest trails · Technical climbs · Steep descents  
📏 **Distance:** 50 KM · [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/16327530315)  
🔗 **Race:** [Jawadhu Hills Ultra 2025](https://chennaitrailclub.in/event-list/2025-2/jawadhu-hills-ultra-jhu-25/)

Jawadhu Hills Ultra was, without doubt, **one of the toughest and most memorable 50K runs** I’ve done so far. True to its reputation, this race fully lived up to the word *ultra*.

As usual, the journey began with a road trip from Bangalore 🚗 — a small group travelling together, mentally preparing for what we knew would be a demanding day. The Jawadhu Hills, tucked away in the Eastern Ghats, feel raw and untouched, and that sense of remoteness sets in even before the race begins.

The course had everything a trail runner could ask for and fear 😄. **Relentless climbs**, **technical downhills**, deep forest trails, and **intense heat** made this a physically and mentally taxing run. There were long stretches where you felt completely alone in the forest 🌳, surrounded by silence and effort, with nothing to focus on except the next step.

Jawadhu isn’t just about elevation; it’s about sustained effort. The climbs were unforgiving, the descents demanded attention, and the heat made energy management critical. Brutal at times, but absolutely worth every step.

What made the experience even better was knowing that my **ultra team buddies** were out there tackling the same beast 🤝. Even though we ran most of the race alone, that shared challenge created a strong sense of connection. Finishing this race felt like a collective achievement.

It was also great meeting runners from across the country and making new trail friends along the way 🌍. Moments like these reinforce why the ultrarunning community feels so special.

A big shoutout to the **Chennai Trail Club** for putting together such a well-organised and memorable event. From logistics to course marking, everything was handled really well — no small feat in such a remote and demanding location.

💡 **Takeaway:** Jawadhu Hills demands respect — steady effort, mental resilience, and humility matter far more than speed on such rugged terrain.

## 🌙 Malnad Ultra Night – 50K

📍 **Location:** Malnad, Western Ghats, Southern India  
📅 **Date:** November 22, 2025  
⛰️ **Elevation:** ~800 m – 1500 m  
📈 **Elevation Gain/Loss:** +1710 m / -1710 m  
🛤️ **Terrain:** ~85% paths · 5% tracks · 10% roads  
🏅 **ITRA Points:** 2  
📏 **Distance:** 50 KM · [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/16540436528)

Malnad Ultra Night was a truly special run for me — **my first-ever night ultra** 🌙. While I had run Malnad earlier in daylight, experiencing the same forests after dark was completely different and unexpectedly intense.

As with most of these races, the journey began with a drive from Bangalore 🚗. On the way, we took a small detour to visit the beautiful and historic towns of **Belur and Halebeedu**, adding a quiet cultural pause before the physical challenge ahead. Those temple visits felt grounding — a calm contrast to the long night that awaited us.

The race unfolded in the heart of the Western Ghats, and the conditions made it even more memorable. It **rained**, the trails were wet, and for long stretches I found myself completely alone in the forest 🌧️🌲 — guided only by my headlamp and the narrow beam of light cutting through the darkness. The silence was deep, broken occasionally by rain, footsteps, or distant sounds of the forest.

Running at night demands a different kind of attention. Pace naturally slows, footing becomes critical, and the mind plays a bigger role than the legs. There were moments of discomfort and uncertainty, but also moments of calm and clarity — the kind that only come when you’re moving alone through a forest at night.

Despite the challenging conditions, the race was exceptionally well supported. A big thank you to the **organisers and volunteers** who stood out there in the rain, deep inside the forest, making sure runners were safe and looked after. Their effort made a tough night feel reassuring.

Crossing the finish line brought a quiet sense of accomplishment — not loud or celebratory, but deeply satisfying. This run wasn’t about speed or timing; it was about experience.

💡 **Takeaway:** Night running strips things down to the basics — focus, patience, and trust in yourself matter more than anything else.

## 🛑 SRT Ultra Pune – 50K (DNF)

📍 **Location:** Pune, Maharashtra, India  
📅 **Date:** December 13, 2025  
⛰️ **Elevation Gain/Loss:** +2253 m / -2182 m  
🛤️ **Terrain:** Mountain trails · Fort climbs · Technical descents  
📏 **Distance:** 52.9 KM · [Strava activity](https://www.strava.com/activities/16767665562)  
🏅 **ITRA:** Solo · 5 aid stations · 400 participants  
🔗 **Race:** Sinhagad–Rajgad–Torna Ultra (SRT)

SRT Ultra Pune was the **final event of my 2025 season**, and in many ways, the most ambitious one. This race wasn’t just about distance — it was about history, terrain, and respect for the mountains that define this iconic route.

The journey itself set the tone. **Four days, four runners, and nearly 2000 km of driving** 🚗 from Bangalore to Pune made this more than just a race trip. Along the way, we met runners from across the country, soaked in the vibrant energy at the expo, and witnessed some fantastic performances by local running groups. It already felt like something special before race day even arrived.

The **Sinhagad–Rajgad–Torna (SRT)** route is steeped in history. These ancient forts once served as critical routes for trading, farming, and warfare, and today they stand as towering reminders of Maharashtra’s rich past. Running through them feels less like a race and more like a moving journey through time.

Race day started early, and the climbs came thick and fast. **Sinhagad and Rajgad** tested strength and focus, but it was the **Rajgad downhills** that truly caught me off guard. I underestimated them, and that mistake gradually added up. By the time I reached the approach to the mighty **Torna climb**, I had narrowly missed the second cut-off.

Calling it a DNF was disappointing, no doubt. But standing there, tired and reflective, it was clear that this race had still given me a lot. The terrain was unforgiving, the elevation relentless, and the margin for error small. Sometimes, the mountains simply demand more.

Despite not finishing, the experience was overwhelmingly positive. The race was **exceptionally well organised**, and a big thank you goes to **Western Ghats Running team** for delivering such a challenging and memorable event.

As we began the long drive back, the excitement had already returned — not for what went wrong, but for what could be done better next time.

💡 **Takeaway:** Big mountain races reward respect and preparation — underestimating terrain is costly, but every setback carries a lesson.

## Final Thoughts – What 2025 Left Behind

Looking back, 2025 wasn’t about chasing timings or ticking boxes. It was about experiences- long road trips from Bangalore, shared stays, quiet forest trails, tough climbs, and the people who made each race meaningful.

Running with a small, familiar group added depth to every event. Whether it was sharing fatigue after a tough race, sitting quietly during long drives back home, or supporting each other through highs and lows, those moments mattered as much as the running itself.

Not every race went to plan, and one ended with a DNF- but that, too, was part of the journey. Each event reinforced something important: patience, humility, preparation, and respect for the terrain.

As the year closed, one thing was clear- the desire to keep exploring longer distances, tougher routes, and more intentional races remains strong.

Onward to 2026.
