[List.js](http://listjs.com/) A 7 KB cross-browser native JavaScript that makes your plain HTML lists super flexible, searchable, sortable and filterable.

This library is still in beta but worth to check.

For more you can check the [README of the project on Github](https://github.com/javve/list#readme).

Good luck.
