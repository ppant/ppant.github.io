**Location:** Ooty, Nilgiris, India

**Elevation:** approx 2100 mt - 2700 mt : elevation gain ~ 1000 mt

**Distance:** 30KM [Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/8816693222)

**Date:** 2nd April 2023

This is my second time at ooty ultra. Check my last year 2022 expereince [here](/2022/04/16/ootyultra_2022_experience.html)

[Ooty Ultra 2023](https://ootyultra.kfita.in/) was my first ultra run experience, though by distance it was less than a full marathon but the level of difficulty and elevation was intense.
To prepare for it I just followed my daily workout i.e. mix of cycling and running and strength workouts. 

**Travel**
This time we took EV car, One of the main challenge was to find a EV charging station, though Suresh has done good research on them but still it was first time and god section to ooty has given us some real hard time. We reached ooty with less than 5% of battery. 

**Stay:**
 Hotel Gem Park is nice place for parking and food. They are very customer friendly.

**Improvement areas:**
<ul>
<li>More cleaning of common areas, dining, etc.</li>
<li>Electric Kettle in rooms for tea/coffee/warm water</li>
</ul>
PS: Don't forget to carry your fav book as there will be plenty of time as there is no network 

**Event:** A very well organized event- lots of hydration points, first aid kiosks etc. Kudos to Coach Kay and his team for all the arrangements. Course was fully road track with excellent views. Second part of the course was more dificult because of sun. 
Overall a good run, we all were able to finish well within given time. Took loads of pictures :-) 


**Final thoughts:**
Oooty Ultra is absolutely wonderful experience. The beauty of the place, route, and overall crowd make it a very special run. 

<ul>
<li>Try to book your stay closer to the start point, though there will not be many... </li>
<li>Start early on the race day from your stay as the road from Attingundi to the start point parking is a single lane, broken tarmac, trail forest road and there might be traffic and restrictions due to sensitive zone </li>
<li>Make sure that you run with someone or find someone to run with at your pace. </li>
<li>Carry some extra clothes, chapels, snacks, charger etc in your car. Mobile network is also a problem so better to keep a spare basic phone with a different network SIM preferably BSNL. </li>
<li>Travel in a group, will be much more enjoyable and safe! </li>
</ul>

This was a brief of our Malnad trip ultra run. I hope to revisit it in 2023.
