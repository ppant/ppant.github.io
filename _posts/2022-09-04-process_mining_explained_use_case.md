In this post, we'll try to explore how to find the right use case for process mining. If you are new to Process Mining, you may read my [last](/tech/2022/08/27/process_mining_explained.html) post on Process Mining.

Process mining can be used in multiple domains mainly where processes are defined. Below is a sample example from an automobile company from which use cases can be taken.

* Purchasing and Finance (improves compliance and automation rates)
* Development (reduces development cycle and increases standards)
* Change Management (improve transparency and product quality)
* Production (reduce throughput times and rework rates)
* Leasing (faster processes)
* User Experience (usage of products)
* Aftersales (optimization of customer touch points)
* IT (optimization of the IT system landscape)
* Data mining techniques are typically not process-centric
* End-to-end process models and concurrency are essentials for process mining
* Process mining assumes event logs where events have timestamps and refer to process instances


In the next post, we'll try to go through Real-life Process Mining Session.
