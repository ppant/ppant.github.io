## Theme

This book deals with quantitative efforts to predict human behavior. The book focuses on a large number of prediction efforts that are much more successful now than efforts some decade back. This is mainly due to faster computing resources and lots of data availability. During the past decade has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. As a result, banks, retailers, political campaigns, doctors and hospitals, and many more organizations have been quite successful&nbsp;of late at predicting the behaviors of particular humans. These efforts have been helpful at winning customers, elections, battle with disease etc. The book provides plenty of case studies from above fields.

## Takeaway

This is fun to read, a fascinating book as this is not very technical so suitable for all masses. Case studies are very good and give you great insight into predictive analytics.  
I highly recommend this book for aspiring Data Scientists/Managers/CEO&#8217;s or anyone interested in understanding the science of analystics. 

Overall good read. Very much recommeded. I personally liked the topics and case studies on risk and fraud detection very well written and visulized. 

## Suggestions

  * This is not technical so don&#8217;t expect details on ML algorithms etc 
  * I found sometimes the case-studies are over-simplified in actual I think they are not that simple while implementing. 
  * I found that one can pick a chapter and read, you don&#8217;t have to&nbsp;follow the order.
  * Don&#8217;t expect that you will learn to do analytics, making a model just by reading this. This book is mainly focussed for non-techies readers. If you are a techie focus more time on ML algorithms and use this book as a part-time <g class="gr_ gr\_1163 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="1163" data-gr-id="1163">bed time</g> read.

Happy reading!
