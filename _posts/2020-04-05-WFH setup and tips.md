Some basic guidelines for work from home:
Desk
Compueter monitor + keyboard mouse combo
Good Wireless Headphone
Good Ventilation

Your work from home setup might different depends on your work profile. Being as a programmer and software architech here is my setup:
Medion Akoya Laptop 16GB RAM + SSD + which I use to run my Linux + VMWare VM + Outlook
Medion desktop + 16GB RAM 
if possible a separate room or corner
2-3 set of montors 

Start you work day at the same time
Follow routine including lunch time
Try to make todo for the next day by the end of current day, I generally have datewise todo list which I prepare in advance so next morning when I start work I already know which tasks to be picked first, I generally pick the most difficult tasks first which requires deep work, most of the time I assign a time slot mostly of 40mins to that task in that duration I put my phone on silient mode, no browser tab opened or onyl opened opened which are really necssary for that task. Idea is to focus fully on task in hand.
