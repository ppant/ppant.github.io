**Location:** [Malnad, Western Ghats, Southern India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malenadu)

**Elevation:** Approx 800 mt - 1500 mt :  Elevation Gain: +1010 mt,  Elevation Loss: -1010 mt

**Distance:** 30KM [Strava link](https://www.strava.com/activities/8169402700)

**Date:** 26th Nov 2022

[Malnad Ultra 2022](https://malnadultra.com/) is a trail run certified by [ITRA](https://itra.run/Races/RaceDetails/Malnad.Ultra.Malnad.Ultra.30.K/2023/78406was) and an UTMB Index Race. This was my first full trail run experience, I must say it was beyond words.

To prepare for it I just followed my daily workout i.e. mix of cycling and running and strength workouts. Before this run I've done a [25K run at Kodagu](https://www.strava.com/activities/7825696133).

**Stay:**
So we stayed at [Jhari Eco Resort](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jhari+Eco+Stay/@13.4222058,75.7417142,17z/data=!4m22!1m12!3m11!1s0x3bbad76619c6e1cf:0x3ce3f6c5e78f4a10!2sJhari+Eco+Stay!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d13.4222058!4d75.7417142!9m1!1b1!16s%2Fg%2F11cp5z5_r0!3m8!1s0x3bbad76619c6e1cf:0x3ce3f6c5e78f4a10!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d13.4222058!4d75.7417142!16s%2Fg%2F11cp5z5_r0?hl=en-GB&entry=ttu) for 2 days with with our ultra running team. It's a unique place, on the route from Kaimara to Atigudi, few things to mention about the place and overall stay.
<ol>
<li>You can't take your car to this location they will send a 4x4 on the main road towards Atingudi so pack your stuff accordingly </li>
<li>Ride to resort in 4x4 can be challenging for very old people or people having heavy back-pain etc this is because of lots of jerks but they have excellent drivers and it's real fun!</li>
<li>There is no network (only limited BSNL) so make sure you inform your family/friends from the main road/car parking.</li>
<li>Because of location and limited transport facilities please make sure that you carry basic essentials like medicines, snacks etc as there is no market and unplanned stepping out is not possible.</li>
<li>Room service is limited so it is better to follow food timings which they serve in the common area. Good clean rooms/toilets lot of natural material have been used. They have integrated resort nicely with nature.</li>
<li>Food is excellent both veg and non-vegetarian, good caring staff.</li>
<li>Excellent waterfall view and natural sound. They organize trek also but we skipped as we were already had enough from our ultra run.ðŸ˜Š</li>
</ol>

**Improvement areas:**
<ul>
<li>More cleaning of common areas, dining etc.</li>
<li>Electric Kattle in rooms for tea/coffee/warm water</li>
</ul>
PS: Don't forget to carry your fav book as there will be plenty of time as there is no network ðŸ˜€

**Event:** First it was a difficult place to reach. Well organized event- First 2-3 KM were downhill but after that till 5-6KM shart climb. First hydration was around that point, views were superb, it mix of running and running. last 8-9 KM were downhill but sun was also there. There were enough hydration points, first aid kiosks etc. Kudos to Coach Anand and his team for all the arrangements in such a remote area. 
I and Suresh has done 30K and Mey has done 50K in Luna Sandels. 

Overall a good run, we all were able to finish well within given time. Took loads of pictures :-) 


**Final thoughts:**
Malnad Ultra is absolutly wonderful experience. The beauty of the place, route and overall crowd makes it very special run. 

<ul>
<li>try to book your stay closer to the start point, though there will not be many... </li>
<li>Start early on the race day from your stay as road toward start point parking is a single lane forest road and there will be traffic and restrictions due to forest area </li>
<li>Make sure that you run with someone or find someone to run with at your pace. </li>
<li>Carry some extra cloths, chapels, food etc in your car. Mobile network is also a problem so better to keep a spare basic phone with differnet network SIM prefeably BSNL. </li>
<li>Travel in a group, will be much more enjoyable and safe! </li>
</ul>

This was a brief of our Malnad trip ultra run. I hope to revisit in 2023.
