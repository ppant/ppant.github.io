Listening on software engineering radio podcast Diomidis Spinellis mentions how debugging is so much important in software development but still, we don&#8217;t teach much in-depth this skill in our universities. I and believe any other programmer will agree that debugging tools are the key arsenal in fixing bugs and even understanding the system. 

Either you use modern tools or just by basic print/printf statements that don&#8217;t matter. Students should learn these key skills and professors should emphasize on educating and not only in universities even in industry set-up when a new developer joins in there should be good exposure to debugging so that they dissect code base and become productive fast.

Worth considering I think &#8230;
