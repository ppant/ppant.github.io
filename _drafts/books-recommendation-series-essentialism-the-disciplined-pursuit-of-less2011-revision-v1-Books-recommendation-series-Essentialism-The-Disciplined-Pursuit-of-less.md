## Theme

The theme of the book is to find out what is truly essential? Focus on essential and eliminate everything else. Greg McKeown defines Essentialism as “Less but better”. 

## Takeaway

The key takeaway is that only once you give yourself the permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter. How often we say “yes” to everything, there is so much going on in our lives that nothing ever gets our true focus and attention. How can we give our best in any area when we’re being pulled in so many different directions? We can’t. We need to identify what is truly important, learn to say no to things that don’t fit into the “essential” category and simplify our lives. This book is an essential read for anyone who feels overcommitted, overloaded, or overworked.

## Suggestions

Very good read. Highly recommended.
