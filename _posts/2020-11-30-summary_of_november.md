So, we are already at the end of the month, as usual, I couldn't write many posts despite multiple posts lying in the draft folder to be published. It was again a busy month also the Diwali festival. In continuation from some of the things from [previous months](/2020/09/30/summary_of_september) this month I was following a couple of new problems.

* I have finally completed a full redesign implementation module, the technologies I have mostly used are Object Oriented Perl, Python, SQL, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, etc. Server-side coding was done in Cent OS Linux env. Actually, I was working on this module for quite some time and after many sprints finally able to push the final code to git. Initial testing results are very encouraging and our team believes that it will have a great performance boost on the customer side. Also, we have designed some new features in UI mainly for providing multiple filtering criteria so will have a better UI experience as well.

* Made a project for [POS tagging](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml) (a NLP problem) using [Hidden Markov Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model). 
 
* Learning more on [LaTeX ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) using [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) online tool. 
 
* Learned and implemented a couple of algorithms for Damage Propagation, Quarantine, and Recovery in databases, also learned about more on distributed technologies like blockchain, how actually mining process takes place. Understood the concepts like Proof-Of-Work. This is really an interesting topic and I should write a separate post on this. 

* Learned about Data Privacy techniques. Implemented a couple of algorithms like k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness their usage, advantages, and drawbacks. 

* Made a mini project to predict the next word in a sentence using Markov models. This can also be used to generate new text based on already trained data. I have trained this model with a couple of [Munshi Premchand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premchand) stories and then asked the model to generate a new story on the theme of trained data. 

I will put a detailed post on some of these topics.

Happy end of the month. 

Cheers!

*TODO: Code to be updated on [Github](https://github.com/ppant).*
