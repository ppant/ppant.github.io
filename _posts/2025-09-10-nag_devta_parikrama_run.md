## Why This Run

The **Nag Mandir Parikrma Run** was not planned as a race or competition.  
It started as a simple idea — to bring people together through movement, promote fitness, and create awareness among the younger generation about healthy lifestyle choices.

Growing up in the hilly regions of Uttarakhand, opportunities for organised sports and fitness activities were limited. This run was a small attempt to change that narrative, even if just for a day.

## Nag Mandir – The Inspiration Behind the Run

The **Nag Mandir** in Berinag is a temple dedicated to **Nage Devta**, the serpent deity traditionally worshipped across this region of the Kumaon Himalayas. For generations, the temple has been an important cultural and spiritual landmark for local communities, symbolising protection, respect for nature, and balance with the surrounding environment.

Situated at an elevation of close to **2,000 metres**, Nag Mandir also served as the **start and finish point** of the Parikrma Run. Choosing this location was intentional — the run was designed not just as a physical activity, but as a symbolic loop around a place deeply rooted in local identity and tradition.

## The Place & the People

Nag Mandir is located in a remote part of the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, surrounded by hills, forests, and quiet village life. The terrain itself naturally encourages movement — walking, climbing, and spending time outdoors.

The run saw participation from local youth, villagers, and visitors. There were no rankings, no timing chips, and no pressure — just people moving together, encouraging each other, and enjoying the experience.

## Landscape

**Berinag**, located in the **Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand**, sits in the Kumaon Himalayas and is known for its expansive views of forested ridgelines and distant Himalayan peaks. The region has a long cultural and spiritual history and remains deeply connected to nature and daily physical activity through walking and hill movement.

This landscape formed the backdrop of the **Nag Mandir Parikrma Run** — quiet roads, gentle climbs, forest sections, and open views that naturally invite movement rather than competition.

## How the Event Came Together

The event was organised with the support of **Nag Mandir Trust** and a small group of volunteers.  
There was **no registration fee**, and participation was open to all.

Several friends from the running community and personal well-wishers quietly supported the initiative through small contributions. This helped cover basic logistics and made it possible to organise the event without external sponsorships. I’m deeply grateful for that support.

## More Than a Run

The core objective of the Parikrma Run was to:
- Encourage **fitness and regular physical activity**
- Create awareness about **staying away from drugs**
- Promote a **healthy and disciplined lifestyle**
- Strengthen a sense of **community participation**

In regions like this, even a small event can have a lasting impression — especially on young minds.

## Personal Reflections

For me, this run was deeply personal. It brought together three important parts of my life:
- Running
- Giving back to the community
- Reconnecting with my roots

It was a reminder that not every meaningful run needs a bib or a finish line. Sometimes, the value lies simply in showing up and doing something positive together.

## Looking Ahead

This was a modest beginning. With continued interest and support, similar community initiatives can be organised in the future — keeping the focus on inclusivity, health, and awareness.

I plan to continue supporting such efforts whenever possible and hope this inspires others to do the same in their own communities.
