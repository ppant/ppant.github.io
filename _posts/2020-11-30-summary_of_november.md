So, we are already at the end of the month, as usual, I couldn't write many posts despite multiple posts lying in the draft folder to be published. It was again a busy month also the Diwali festival. In continuation from some of the things from [previous months](/2020/09/30/summary_of_september) this month I was following a couple of new problems.

* Completed a full redesign implementation module at my work, this piece of imple is huge because I was working on that for a couple of months and hopefully will have a great impact on the performance and usability of the software.  

* Made a project for [POS tagging](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml) (a NLP problem) using [Hidden Markov Models}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model). 
 
* Learning more on [LaTeX ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) using [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) online tool. 
 
* Learned and implemented a couple of algorithms for Damage Propagation, Quarantine, and Recovery in databases, also learned about more on distributed technologies like blockchain, how actually mining process takes place. This is really an interesting topic and I should write a separate post on this. 

* Learned about Data Privacy techniques. Implemented a couple of algorithms like k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness their usage, advantages, and drawbacks. 

* Made a mini project to predict the next word in a sentence using Markov models. This can also be used to generate new text based on already trained data. I have trained this model with a couple of [Munshi Premchand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premchand) stories and then asked the model to generate a new story on the theme of trained data. 

I will put a detailed post on some of these topics.

Happy end of the month. 

Cheers!
