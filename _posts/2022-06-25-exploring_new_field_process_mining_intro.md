Finally able to write a new post :-)

So for the last couple of months, I was busy solving some critical customer problems and another important thing I was doing is to try to understand a new field called "Process mining". 

So the first question comes What is the field about? and why I am digging into this area of technology?  
ok, in one of my major projects we develop software for helping companies to automate their workflow which will ensure Quality assurance which leads to ISO certifications. So, I can say that I have a fair understanding of how business processes work, how can we automate the workflows for business processes and the challenges in implementing them. One of the key questions is do people really follow defined business processes? If not what path they take? and many others questions...

So here comes my quest for exploring the area. I was mainly interested in knowing if recent advancements in data science can help in improving business processes and workflows. So here comes "Process Science" and finally "Process Mining" which we'll explore.

 In this write-up and series of posts, I will try to give you a brief idea about what Process Mining is, and how it is connected with data mining and traditional business process management, we'll also discuss some of the use-cases. My aim is to give you the information in easy to understanding manner.

 Process mining is a very exciting field and we hope a lot of new tools and technologies will be developed in the future. So let's start. We'll cover broadly the following things:

1. Business Analytics
2. Process Science
3. Data mining and Process Mining
4. Process mining use cases and real-world scenerios
5. Future work in process mining and challenges


In my next post we'll directly start with what process science is and how this is connected with data science.
