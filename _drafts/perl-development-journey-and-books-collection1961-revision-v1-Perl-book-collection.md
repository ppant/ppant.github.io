Over the year preciely I ahve started working full fekdghed in perl from fall 2007. Before that I was mainly in C, C++, assembly. My initial imression was not very good mainly due to syntax and being from C++ backgroud it was really diffierent and diffcult to see how OOP call s works in Perl. But over the years working with language and developing a large scale web application I learned a lot of nitty gritty of the language and still learning. During my ongoing journey I am listing the books which I have read and are in my collection.
