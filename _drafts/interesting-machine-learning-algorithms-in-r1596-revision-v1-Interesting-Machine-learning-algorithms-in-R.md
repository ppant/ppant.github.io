## Widely used Machine learning algorithms in R

  * Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) &#8212; [MASS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/index.html) package of R can be used
  * Regression (Linear & Logistic)
  * Naive Bayes
  * Support vector machines (SVM)
  * Classification and regression trees
  * Random forests (Tree based modelling) &#8212; There is excellent package [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/index.html) in R
  * K-Means clustering &#8212; [Kmeans](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/kmeans.html) package of R can be used
  * Boosting

One must check [caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) package of R it has plenty of function to perform many MI tasks like classification, training etc.  Finally,  [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) is the place one should visit for R packages.
