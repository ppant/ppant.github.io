Hello

We have a Delhi.pm Perl Monger Group in New Delhi, India. The group is almost  inactive for some years (except monthly mail of mailing list membership detail). I am trying to revive Delhi.pm and need suggestions from community.

I have already created a [Google + page](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/113017661589594992511/113017661589594992511/about) to spread the word. Actually, we have a [mailing list](http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/delhi-pm/) but I assume that most of the members are either inactive or not working in Perl anymore.  I know many active Perl programmers in Delhi but they are not connected.

Do let me know your thoughts to make Delhi.pm active? Comments/advice are most welcome.

Thanks,
