Generally, I only post technical contents in this blog, but this time there is an urge from inside to write due to unprecedented scenarios all over the world due to [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) scare. Today is the [Janata Curfew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Curfew) here in India which our PM has [initiated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9SRmRMv64s) Whole day we were homebound and in the evening everyone came out in their balconies and doing chant, ringing bells, clapping, etc. This is how it was -- [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qWixB_Mm9g) 

It was such an outstanding experience. This is people's support & respect for all medical & essential support personnel who are working tirelessly to combat. Right now, we as a country are in very critical junction, the future of us will be based on how resilient we are. Future gen will remember this a great community effort to save mankind.

India's one of the biggest train network is closed, taxi service is suspended, most of the cities are in lockdown state except essential services. This is happening all over the world. Hope we'll get through it.... 

This is an exceptionally difficult time and I feel that we should keep our mind in control and fight with our full strength and follow govt and experts. We as a human being evolved in millions of years so I think our body knows how to get rid of unwanted bug but maybe because of the way we live and treat nature this mechanism has shut itself? High time to re-initiate and learn from the mistakes we are doing in the name of blind progress. I think nature is telling us that this planet equally belongs to other living beings as well. 

So mind the gap and learn to co-exist. Scientifically we can't live without them but I think they can... I hope we get through this difficult phase and learn...

Praying for all human beings all over the world.

Take care!

***Update March 25, 2020:*** *Indian Pm has announced 21 day full lockdown -  [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yYoR6KmNEU). This is unprecendted. Imagine 1.3bn people staying in home, one of the biggest isloation exercise. Nobody knows what will be the outcome of this hope we succeed in slowing down the spread of virus? This step will have huge impact on economy for sure but as PM says that first priority is to save the lives. Let's pray and hope for the best and stay indoor.*

***Update March 28, 2020:*** *We are in lockdown for last 4 days. Such a nice weather outside, it rained yesterday, clear sky first time pollution level is so low < 50. 
![Clear sky March 28 2020.png](\data\images\clear_sky_delhi_march_2020.jpeg)This is the best time to be outdoors just before summer sets in but in this challenging time we are follwoing the instructions and staying at home so that our front warriers can do their job. I think one of the aspect we miss at this time is the mental health, I was Listning to this lady , very balanced talk [clip](https://youtu.be/a3MsgIo0w54). She talks about how to keep mind in control in this crisis time and get over your fear. .*
