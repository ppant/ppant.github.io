a small imple of jQuery accordion (show/hide blocks)

Accordions (extend/collapse) are useful when you want to toggle between hiding and showing a large amount of content. I have made a small demo using jQuery accordion lib. Check my code at [github](https://github.com/ppant/jshacksï»¿).  


You can also check a live [demo](https://jsfiddle.net/ppant/mk2n9c8t/) here
