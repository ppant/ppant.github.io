I am invited by Pradeep to write this blog by surprise and hence this is a spontaneous attempt to pen down my thoughts, I strongly feel about. We engineers solve problems in our day to day job leveraging technology which make profound impact business and hence enjoy the value in this knowledge base economy today. But what is the most important dimension of the solution ? Most of the time we get carried away by the technology used in the solution and try to use the most niche & latest technology to solve the problem. While the real beauty lies in the contextualization of solution in the problem space, most of the time if problem is well understood and appreciated solution could be much simpler. The need is to understand the problem well before solving it. Design thinking is way develop the appreciation of the all dimensions of problem with user point of view and helps to develop the romance between user and problem solver. This romance brings contextualization which is key success factor or the solution. The second most important dimension is the way implementation of solution is executed.
