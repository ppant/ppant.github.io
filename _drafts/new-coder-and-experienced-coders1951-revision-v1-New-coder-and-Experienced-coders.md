<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    I’ve found that a big difference between new coders and experienced coders is faith: faith that things are going wrong for a logical and discoverable reason, faith that problems are fixable, faith that there is a way to accomplish the goal. The path from “not working” to “working” might not be obvious, but with patience, you can usually find it.

  <cite>Read the above quote somewhere on <a href="https://medium.com&quot;">medium</a>, myself as a programmer can easily sync with the saying. Have observed this many many times in my coding experience of the last two decades. To add, patience is needed much more while dealing with critical real-time production bugs. </cite>

I personally feel that analysis of the problem with a cool head and focus and pateince is is the key to debug and resolve critical problems.

Happy Coding!
