Good opportunity to submit a paper in this upcoming [International Workshop on Serverless Machine Learning for Intelligent and Scalable AI Workflow](https://sites.google.com/view/serverlessworkshop/home?authuser=0)

In recent years with the advancement of Cloud computing, containerization,  Serverless computing has revolutionized how we develop modern applications. Some of the most popular serverless computing services are [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Google Cloud functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions), [Azure functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/serverless-computing/). The advantage of using these services is that it can run custom code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources. That's a huge advantage and with cloud pipeline, this can be done with a continuous stream of data as well.

*<g>In my view, upcoming years will be very exciting and challenging for developing efficient cloud-native applications. So a lot of research will be needed. I am keeping a close watch on how AutoML and serverless coming will work together efficiently, the security of ML models from various attacks, the privacy of training data, and Explainable AI.</g>*

 
Coming back to the conference, below is the broad topic list in which papers can be submitted. 

* <b>AI application demonstration using serverless technology</b> 

* <b>Design, Development and API extension for popular ML library such as  sklearn to natively support serverless</b>

* <b>Experimental Analysis of Serverless vs traditional pre-configured</b>

* <b>Workflow manager design</b>

* <b>Scalability and fault tolerance</b>

* <b>Automated ML using serverless</b>

* <b>Feature engineering</b>

* <b>Benchmark papers including emerging technology such as Ray</b>

* <b>Explanability scale out</b>

* <b>Case studies</b>

* <b>On demand data cleaning and repair</b>

* <b>Web-service scaling</b>
