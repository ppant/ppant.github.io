If you want a break from your routine work (Writing code, testing etc) then like me you can also attend online courses form [Stanford university](http://www.stanford.edu/). I am starting my AI, DB and MI class videos today.

<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>If you have not signed up for the free classes from Stanford, I believe today (10th Oct 2011) is your last day.</strong></span>

I signed up for all three, [Artificial Intelligence](http://www.ai-class.com/), [Machine Learning](http://www.ml-class.org/), and [Intro to Databases](http://www.db-class.org/).

All courses will have tests. I have just completed Unit-1 of AI course. You can also check the [youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/knowitvideos).

Best of luck.
