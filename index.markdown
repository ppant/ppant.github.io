## About Me

Welcome! My name is **Pradeep Pant (प्रदीप पन्त)**, a proud native of the majestic lower Himalaya (हिमालय). I began this blog in the autumn of 2007 to chronicle my journey and share thoughts on the ever-evolving world of technology. Over the years, it has become a space where I explore ideas, document experiences, and share knowledge with fellow enthusiasts. By profession, I am a **Software Architect and AI/ML practitioner** with over **20 years of experience** in building enterprise software solutions. I am passionate about solving complex problems and believe that programming is a powerful tool capable of turning imagination into reality at astonishing speed. My expertise spans **Programming, machine learning, generative AI, and software architecture**, and I am dedicated to continuous learning and exploration. Currently, I work as an **AI/ML & Generative AI Architect at LTIMindtree**, while pursuing a **PhD in Process Mining and Machine Learning at IIIT Allahabad**. My work includes designing scalable solutions, mentoring teams, contributing to open-source projects, and publishing research that bridges industry and academia. When I’m not coding or analyzing algorithms, you’ll find me running ultramarathons, exploring nature, or sharing knowledge through blog posts.
