## About Me

Welcome! My name is **Pradeep Pant (प्रदीप पन्त)**, a proud native of the majestic lower Himalaya (हिमालय). I began this blog in the autumn of 2007 to chronicle my journey and share thoughts on the ever-evolving world of technology. Over the years, it has become a space where I explore ideas, document experiences, and share knowledge with fellow enthusiasts.

By profession, I am a **Software Architect and AI/ML practitioner** with over **20 years of experience** in building enterprise software solutions. I am passionate about solving complex problems and believe that programming is a powerful tool capable of turning imagination into reality at astonishing speed. My expertise spans **Programming, Machine Learning, Generative AI, and Software Design & Architecture**, and I am dedicated to continuous learning and exploration. Currently, I work as an **AI/ML & Generative AI Architect at LTIMindtree**, while pursuing a **PhD in Process Mining and Machine Learning at IIIT Allahabad**. My work includes designing scalable solutions, mentoring teams, contributing to open-source projects, and publishing research that bridges industry and academia. When I’m not coding or analysing algorithms, you’ll usually find me running ultramarathons, exploring nature, or sharing knowledge through my blog.
