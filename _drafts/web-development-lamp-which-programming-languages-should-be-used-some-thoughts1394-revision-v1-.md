Now a days people keep asking which technolgy stack to be used for web develpment and finally which progarmming languages. Mainly if you are using LAMP stack you have a lot of options. I personally think that decsion should mainly be based on the requirement, confort with the language, team etc . Here is my understanding a thoughts on which langauges should be used:

Perl:  
Pros: Old fellow still widely used, Very powerful, secure, well tested over the years in web dev, very good market repo among users, huge collection of open source libraries, new framework like Dancer, Mojolicious are positive sign.  
Cons: Difficult to maintain (dirty syntax etc), Hard to get resources, industry is not very positive about its future versions.

Python:  
Pros: Powerful, widely used in handling scientific data, academics, analytics, system administrators, Market sentiment is positive, Very good framework like Django.  
Cons: Less flexible, performance issues mainly threading.

PHP:  
Pros: Most preferred language, widely used, fast development, big community, huge available resource pool.  
Cons: Some reported security loopholes, Less trustworthy, Market image as cheap and dirty option for quick development, multi-threading issue, debugging issues.

Ruby:  
Pros: Very flexible, good support, positive image in communities, Very popular framework for web development (ROR).  
Cons: Some benchmarks shows that its request-response time is a bit slow than others in same category, Getting good resources can be difficult.
