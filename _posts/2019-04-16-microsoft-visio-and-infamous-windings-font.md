Another Microsoft misery<img class="emoji" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/svg/1f622.svg" alt="ðŸ˜¢" /> Â <img class="emoji" draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/svg/1f622.svg" alt="ðŸ˜¢" />

This time, I am struggling to handle the bullets in SVG output of my drawing.Â  What I found is thatÂ  MS Visio still uses windings/symbol fonts to make the bullets. Don&#8217;t know why? When are they going to change this and start using standard Unicode chars? Can anyone from MS please explains to me why they don&#8217;t believe in standardization?

IMHO Please use Unicode everywhere be it HTML generated from Word or Visio etc.Â 

Thanks for reading!
