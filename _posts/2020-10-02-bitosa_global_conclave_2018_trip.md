I randomly found a small video on youtube 
This was from Jan 2018 when I along with KK Sir (BE 79 batch) and Ajay Sir (BE 81 batch) had gone to Jaipur to attend the Global [BITOSA](https://www.bitosaglobal.org/) Conclave. It was a fun and memorable trip, We three drove from Delhi to Jaipur. Meeting with old BITians was a great experience!!
