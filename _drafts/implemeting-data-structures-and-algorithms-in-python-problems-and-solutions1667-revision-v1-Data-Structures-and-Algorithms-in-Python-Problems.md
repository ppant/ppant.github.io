As now I have started using Python in a lot of places including data science so thought to solve problems using data structures using Python. Till now I have mostly done implemented in C and Perl. This is my try to solve using Python. The inspiration of solving problems with Python DS is from [this](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews/learn/v4/overview) course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).

Recently I am trying to implement some common Data structure examples.

## Anagram algorithm

    Algorithm will take two strings and check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when the two strings can be written using the exact same letters in other words rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once
    
    Some examples of anagram:
    "dormitory" is an anagram of "dirty room"
    "a perfectionist" is an anagram of "I often practice."
    "action man" is an anagram of "cannot aim"
    
    Our anagram check algorithm with take two strings and will give a boolean TRUE/FALSE depends on anagram found or not?

Check [GitHub](https://github.com/ppant/DS-Algos-Python) for the full working code.

I will keep adding more problems/solutions.

Stay tuned!
