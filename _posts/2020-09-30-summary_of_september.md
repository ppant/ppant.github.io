So, we are already at the end of the month, as usual, I couldn't write many posts despite multiple posts lying in the draft folder to be published. It was such a busy month, here are a few things which I was doing and hopefully will continue in next month.
* Working on Elastic Search - ELK stack on Cent OS, excellent combo, they have made a great business model with a Lucence-based index engine. 
* A bit of play with RHEL ansible platform -- Very promising 
* Checking PSGI as a CGI replacement, looks promising as a good middle layer
* Checking out Modern Perl frameworks like Dancer2, Mojolious, and Catalyst, are they useful or just overhead for bigger projects?
* Checking out new programming lang Raku (Perl 6 -> Raku), progress, future?
* Learning more on Probabilistic Graphical models 
* Learned about a joint probability distribution, Conditional Probability Distribution
* Learning how to use [LaTeX ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)
* Learned about database attacks like SQL injection. Learned about Merkel Trees and have implemented techniques to avoid these attacks
* Learned about database watermarking techniques
* Learning about [Restricted Boltzman Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_Boltzmann_machine), an artificial neural network which can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs.
* Learned how to use [Chow-Liu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow%E2%80%93Liu_tree) tree in joint probability distribution


I will put detailed post on some of them.

Happy end of the month.

Cheers!
