I found a new book on Perl called <a href="http://www.greglondon.com/iperl/index.htm" target="_blank">Impatient Perl</a>. This is the book for the readers who want to speed up there Perl learning. One thing which I found interesting it the way some topics are explained.

Good work [Greg](http://www.greglondon.com/)!
