In this COVID-19 lockdown time I am sure many of us wants to learn new things. In technology stack **Machine Learning** is the most sought field. As we all know there is no dearth of tutorials/courses on internet. I think the wisdom lies in choosing one which suits your own learning methdology and also from an authentic source and teacher. 

In this pots, I will suggest you few approches amd resources which I have used in learning ML over the years. 

### Bottom-up-Approach
#### Coursera-Stanford Machine Learning 
This couse taught by one of the best mind in AI/ML community [andrew NG](http://www.andrewng.org/) apart from great researcher and enterporener andrew is a great teacher as well. In this course he starts with mathematical concepts behgind the concepts and finally implement them using Octave programming language. I took this course in 2016. Actually I have registered for this course when it was first started way back in Oct 2011 check my [blog post](/2011/10/10/online-ai-course-at-standford/) but unable to complete and after that I started and multiple times but coudn't complete due to time constraint but when I started my data science specilization in Feb 2016, I took it serously and completed this course See [Slides](/2016/06/30/stanford-machine-learning-class-slides/), Earned [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/AXEA8RN9MCBH?utm_source=link&utm_campaign=copybutton_certificate&utm_product=course). The course use a rather unconvential sceintific programming language [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). This is a Powerful mathematics-oriented syntax with built-in plotting and visualization tools. It's a bit like MatLab which I have used in college. 

### Top-Down Approach
#### fast.ai Course
This course is taught by [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward). Unlike bottom up approach in which first the theory and maths behind a particular concept is explained, top-down approach generally starts with code samples and example and then some theory. Geremy's excellent [fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/) course follows this approach. It uses [Python](https://www.python.org/) as programming language but I heard Geremy mentioned about [Swift](https://swift.org/) lang in new version. 
The whole fast.ai course is in two parts. Second part is more advanced. I took first part last year and found very enriching. It complement the andrew machine learning course in coding part.
I have written couple of post from this course. see below: 
*   [Image Classicfication Basics](/2020/02/29/Image-classification-of-Indian-cows-breed-using-fastai-lib)
*   [Image classification of Indian cows breed using fastai lib](/2020/03/28/Image-classification-of-Indian-cows-breed-using-fastai-lib_model_training)

Now, One of the basic question might come that in which sequence these two couses should be taken, my advice whould be that if you are a hands on coder and the you can start with fast.ai course but should checkout andrew's course for concepts and Maths.
Apart from taking these 2 course, I would also suggest to listen to Data Sceince podcasts (I have shared my list in one of my previous posts). One of the tip is to just listen to these podcasts not anything else idea is to keep your mind always thinking about ML nothing else, that way you can learn faster and make deep understanding of concepts. 

You can also checkout [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for real-world problems but I would suggest to hold a bit and do not participate in competitions till the time you are majorly done with the courses. 

Wishing you very good learning.

Cheers!
