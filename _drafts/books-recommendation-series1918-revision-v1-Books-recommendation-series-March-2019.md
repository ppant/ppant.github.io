Since long I was thinking to put down my recommendation of the books I have read recently. I like to post atleast one book recommendation.  
Check below my first recommendation. 

## Book name

Elements of statistical learning  
Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009 )  
 <https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/>  


## Theme

During the past decade has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. The book&#8217;s coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting&#8211;the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.Â  

## Takeaway

Good book
