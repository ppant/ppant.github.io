In this COVID-19 scenerio eveyone is trying Work From Home depends on  job profile. 
 
Some basic guidelines for work from home:
- Good quality Desk
- Min 2 monitors + keyboard mouse combo
- Good Wireless Headphone
- Good natural light and Ventilation
- if possible a separate room or corner


Your work from home setup might different depends on your work profile. Being as a programmer here is my setup:

Hardware:

- Medion Akoya Laptop 16GB RAM + SSD + which I use to run my Linux + VMWare VM + Outlook
- Medion desktop + 16GB RAM 
- NAS server

Software for managing multiple screens:

- Synergy for synching mouse and keyboard
- Evernote for creating and sharing notes
- Slack
- TeamViewer
- Skype

Start you work day at the same time

Follow routine including lunch time

Try to make todo for the next day by the end of current day, I generally have datewise todo list which I prepare in advance so next morning when I start work I already know which tasks to be picked first, I generally pick the most difficult tasks first which requires deep work, most of the time I assign a time slot mostly of 40mins to that task in that duration I put my phone on silient mode, no browser tab opened or onyl opened opened which are really necssary for that task. Idea is to focus fully on task in hand.
