So, we are already at the end of the month, I couldn't write many posts despite multiple posts lying in the draft folder to be fine tuned and published. Current month was very busy, later half mostly into log4j understanding and fixing. Apart from office here are a few things which I was doing and hopefully will continue in next month.

* log4j/log4shell: Working on this with team for solution, finally before Chrismas wer were able to secure our customer machines in cloud and on-premise.
* Worked on a project which deals with Object detection over scientific project using Deep learning" 
* Attended a course of Advanced Data Analytics
* Attended a International Author Workshop on how to write quality research papers
* Attended IEEE school on Advances in Biometrics and deep learning
* Completed review of Python Archtecure Patterns book by Packt publishing
* Retarted my road cycling overall good month for running as well. 

Cheers!
