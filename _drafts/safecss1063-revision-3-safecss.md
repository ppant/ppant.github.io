/*  
Welcome to Custom CSS!

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a kind of code that tells the browser how  
to render a web page. You may delete these comments and get started with  
your customizations.

By default, your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets,  
which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme CSS  
rules. Just write here what you want to change, you don&#8217;t need to copy all  
your theme&#8217;s stylesheet content.
