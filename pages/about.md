Hello Guest,	
Welcome to my blog. My name is Pradeep Pant. By profession, I am a Software Engineer, coding for more than 2 decades. I live in the historic city of [New Delhi, India,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi) the capital of India. I love solving problems and believe that programming has the great power to transform human imagination into reality in a very short time. Well, I might not be the best engineer but I do constantly try my best to learn new things. Apart from this, I have various interests like trekking, hiking in mountains especially [Himalaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas) (probably because I have seen these snowy mountains all through my childhood), running, cycling, meditation, nature photography and reading. 

Thanks for visiting.
